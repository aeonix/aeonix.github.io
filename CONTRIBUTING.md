# Website contribution guidelines

### Writing style

Try to keep your writing clear and concise. Your explanations should be comprehensive, but easy to follow. The more precise your writing is, the easier others will find it to follow. We also hope to have our documentation translated into multiple languages in the future - keeping it simple and to the point will reduce the workload in the translation process.

Here are some general guidelines and reminders for tone and style:

* Write accessibly in clear, simple sentences intended for a global audience. Avoid colloquial language, humour, cultural references, and personal opinion. Keep your writing technical.
* Avoid jargon and acronyms, if you can. Spell out acronyms at least once per page.
* Avoid mentioning or crediting specific people outside of the references section.
* Be consistent. Use the same consistently-formatted word or phrase for a concept throughout the documentation.
* Don't qualify or prejudge actions. Don't write that something is "easy" or "quick" as this is a deterrent if the user is not able to complete the action.
* Don't reference future development or features that don't yet exist.
* Remember to use sentence case for page titles and section headings.

### Formatting 

* Maintain structure and format conventions already established for text-width, title bolding, etc.
* Maintain code conventions already established in index.html for new breaks on tags.
* No images, links, emojis or other elements within the website except for the references which can contain external links and the about section which has a fixed set of links for essential purposes.
* No additional pages should be added outside of the index.html.
* Refrain from using references as parts of speech.

### References

* Follow example references' formats. New references are appended to the bottom of the page in the order they were added.
* Referenced files should be hosted internally within the files/ directory.

### Editing

* Version updates: New versions should be reflected in the About section in the single line with the same format. 
* Top links should only be changed if they are no longer accessbile. No new links should be added.
* No additional javascript, CSS styles or other elements should be added. 
* Additional sections, headers and body text can be added. 
* The readme and contributing documents are to be identical.
