Abstract

   This document is part of the CryptoNote Standards describing a peer-
   to-peer anonymous payment system. It defines the core concepts of the
   CryptoNote technology and surveys the whole system's workflow. All
   transactions are public data and are stored by every peer, yet none
   of the private information is revealed. Payments cannot be
   unambiguously traced to senders; transfers can only be interlinked by
   their owners. Peers validate all the data and rely on proof of work
   to reach a consensus. The proof-of-work function guarantees
   egalitarian voting, so that none of the participants can utilize
   special purpose devices to obtain an excessive voting advantage.

1. Introduction

   CryptoNote is a technology that allows anonymous, unlinkable and
   untraceable peer-to-peer payments. 

   The system is based on Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin [BITCOIN] concept:
   a distributed public ledger (blockchain) of transactions (ordered
   records of money transfers). Each peer stores a local copy of
   blockchain and verifies every new transaction. Hash-based proof of
   work [POW] is the solution to "the problem of determining
   representation in majority decision making", when some of the data
   was missed by an offline peer. If there are multiple conflicting
   versions, peers choose the one with more work presented. All data is
   sent on the best-effort basis.

3. CryptoNote Protocol

   This section describes the principles of the CryptoNote technology.


3.1  Transactions

   Each user possesses several unique secret keys, each associated with
   a certain amount of money. A key gives user the ability to spend the
   money, lock, or even destroy it. At any moment there is a definite
   many-to-one mapping between all currency units and keys.

   User can divide his funds into smaller pieces or merge several
   amounts into one by reassigning ownership from his old keys to new
   ones. Each set of such transfers forms a new transaction that will be
   stored in the blockchain. Each key (old or new one) belongs to a
   sender or to some other user (i.e. there might be several senders and
   addressees in a single transaction). See [CNS004] for details.

   After a transaction has been created and sent to other peers, it
   exists in one of the four possible states:

      1. Unconfirmed: every peer is aware of the transaction, but it is
      not included in the blockchain yet. 

      2. Confirmed: the transaction is now a part of the blockchain. In
      case of a blockchain fork, newly confirmed transactions may become
      unconfirmed again.

      3. Irreversible: the transaction has stayed confirmed for some
      time. The probability of an irreversible transaction becoming
      unconfirmed is negligible.

      4. Rejected: the transaction is not included into the blockchain,
      since a contradicting one (involving the same funds) has been
      confirmed. These transactions cannot be stored in the same
      blockchain branch, therefore any rejected transaction should be
      abandoned.


   The users' privacy depends on how the transactions are constructed.
   The properties described below are integral parts of the CryptoNote
   anonymous transactions technology:

      1. Untraceability: it is impossible to determine the exact sender
      of a transaction.

      2. Unlinkability: it is impossible to determine whether any two

      transactions are sent to the same address.


3.1.1  Transaction Untraceability

   The untraceability requirement can be fulfilled through ring
   signatures [TRS]. Any signature is, in fact, a proof of the user's
   knowledge of the secret key that allows spending the corresponding
   amount of money. Regular digital signature schemes ((EC)DSA or
   similar) reveal the signer's identity, since they use only one public
   key for the verification procedure. 

   Unlike regular digital signature schemes, a ring signature is a much
   more sophisticated scheme that allows a user to sign his message on
   behalf of a group. A verifier is able to see that the message was
   signed by someone within the group of signers, but he is not able to
   determine the exact signer. All public keys required for verification
   are indistinguishable in that sense.

   To prove the ownership of the money the user randomly chooses public
   keys of other users and then adds his key to produce a ring signature
   that must be verified with all these keys. The owner of one of those
   keys may produce his own ring signature with the same set of public
   keys (making his own transaction), and there will still be no way
   (better than guessing with 1/n probability) to determine from which
   particular key the money was reassigned.

   There are several ring signature schemes. An implementor should use a
   scheme, which is not completely anonymous, but allows to check
   whether two signatures were made under the same secret key. Every
   peer should be able to perform this check to prevent double-spending.
   One possible algorithm is described in [TRS].

   See [CNS002] for details.


3.1.2  Transaction Unlinkability

   Usually a person has a public address that unambiguously identifies
   him. However, none of his incoming transactions should expose the
   connection with this address.

   This can be achieved through generating a unique key for each
   transfer with the modified Diffie-Hellman protocol [DH]. The original
   scheme allows two parties to produce a common secret by exchanging
   data via open channels. In CryptoNote, public keys are generated in
   such a way that only the recipient can link them to his account,
   while even the sender cannot recover the corresponding secret key.
 


Hawking et al.           CryptoNote Technology                  [Page 4]

CRYPTONOTE STANDARD 009                                      August 2013


   The sender uses the address and his random data to create a new
   public key and transfers money to it. The recipient scans all the
   keys in new transactions and checks if he can recover the
   corresponding secret key. If he succeeds, he learns that he is the
   new owner of the money, i.e. the transfer is completed. The keys can
   only be linked by the receiver, as this requires the knowledge of the
   secret key corresponding to the address.

   See [CNS006] for details.


3.2  Blocks

   All transactions are stored in a single distributed ledger that
   consists of chained blocks. Each block contains a hash reference to
   its predecessor, several new transactions that have been sent since
   the previous block, and some additional information, such as a
   timestamp and nonce (see below). To go along with Nakamoto's notation
   [BITCOIN], we will call this ledger the blockchain.

   A consensus on the state of the blockchain is achieved by a voting
   mechanism called proof of work. Each block is considered valid only
   if the value of a special hash function of this block is less than
   the target value. Peers that choose to participate in the voting
   alter the block by iterating the value of the nonce field in the
   header of the block. If the hash of the resulting block meets the
   above criterion, the block is added to the blockchain. This
   stochastic process provides a continual supply of new blocks. If two
   or more blocks with the same predecessor appear simultaneously, a
   blockchain fork occurs. If this happens, each peer can choose any of
   the branches as a current one. Eventually one of the branches will
   outrun the other one, making all peers switch to it. 

   See [CNS003] for details.


3.3  Proof-of-Work Function

   Voting on the state of the blockchain is performed through
   calculation of a special hash function. The right choice of the
   function is of fundamental importance.

   The main concern is security. The blockchain model is proved by
   Nakamoto's Bitcoin [BITCOIN] to be safe in case more than 50% of the
   hashing power is under the control of honest users. Therefore, a
   potential attacker should not be able to acquire massive hashing
   power. There should not be a significantly cheaper source of powerful
   hardware beyond the reach of ordinary users. For this reason memory-

   bound algorithms are superior to CPU-bound.

   Another issue with PoW is the nature of voting. Any public mechanism
   of a majority decision-making process must satisfy a natural
   assumption of egalitarianism. There may be several contradictory
   transactions that result in two or more valid versions of the
   blockchain (a blockchain fork). Since only one of the versions will
   win, it must represent the majority of people, i.e. all users must be
   nearly equal in terms of hashing power to guarantee the "majority
   rule".

   Generally, the hash function must not allow a user to have a
   significant advantage over another. The most acceptable way of
   discovering new blocks is to use regular hardware, such as a PC, and
   utilize uniformly distributed resource (such as fast on-chip memory,
   not just CPU power [MBOUND]). Special purpose devices may always be
   possible in theory, but their manufacturing costs should be as high
   as possible. With the billions of PCs running and millions being
   produced every day, an emergence of ASICs with a comparable
   speed/cost ratio is inconceivable.

   See [CNS008] for the description of CryptoNote default proof-of-work
   function.


3.4  Adjustable Parameters

   There are many internal parameters in CryptoNote that affect the
   performance of the system. The size of blocks and transactions is
   limited in order to prevent a flood attack. The proof-of-work
   difficulty changes following the hashrate of the whole network to
   provide nearly constant time between new blocks. Sometimes these
   parameters need to be changed.

   There are two ways of changing the parameters: manual (developers
   change the parameters with a new software release) or automatic.
   However, the first option is not suitable for a distributed software,
   as it is crucial that the values of the parameters are the same for
   all peers and it is not feasible to make all the peers upgrade
   simultaneously.

   CryptoNote uses adaptive algorithms instead of hardcoded values. New
   values are computed for each new block on the basis of past data. The
   values should be adequate to the current state of the system and no
   one should be able to arbitrarily manipulate these values unless he
   has the majority of hashrate. Only robust statistics should be used
   (for example, the median should be used instead of the mean value).

4. Asset Exchange

   CryptoNote is an ownership tracking system. It means that the keys
   can be associated not only with the money but with any digital asset
   as well. It is possible to create a separate blockchain with its own
   inner currency and distinct rules. An alternative blockchain can
   reuse the proof of work from the main one. As a result, both systems
   will combine their hashing powers for better protection against
   possible attacks.

   Alternatively, a person can use an already existing blockchain as a
   platform for a public offering. By proving his ownership of some keys
   and announcing that these keys are now associated with a new type of
   assets (i.e. company's shares), he can manage these assets within the
   blockchain. Asset ownership can be transferred privately just like
   money. The only limitation is that it should not be mixed with
   another currency or asset; every ring signature must use the keys of
   the same "color".

   The concept of "colors" within a single blockchain can evolve into a
   system more powerful than just a p2p transactions ledger. By
   introducing new types of transactions it is possible to create a
   private decentralized exchange with any type of assets: money,
   shares, or commodities.
