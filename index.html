    <h3> About </h3>
    <p> Aeon was annouced on BitcoinTalk forums in June of 2014 as a copy of
      Monero code and the genesis block was mined shortly thereafter. Since
      then, the Aeon codebase has intentionally been kept close to Monero's in
      order to benefit from the higher code reliability (due to the larger
      resources of peer reviewing available to Monero). Over time, Aeon has
      evolved a few critical differences such as size 3 ring signatures,
      asic-friendly mining, and omitting ring-ct proofs. As a direct result of
      this, Aeon serves as a unique alternative to Monero. All coins have been
      100% proof-of-work mined with no coin sale, no ICO, no pre-mine, no tax
      etc. </p>

    <h3> 1. Mission </h3>
    <p> Being a fork of Monero, Aeon shares most of its codebase with Monero
      while making a few critical modifications such that it can offer a unique
      alternative. The codebase is intentionally kept close to Monero's in order
      to benefit from the higher code reliability (due to the larger source of
      peer reviewing available in Monero). By maintaining a stable codebase,
      Aeon can ensure security and fairness for all network participants. [15]
    </p>
    <h3> 2. Economics </h3>
    <h4> Total Supply </h4>
    <p> There is always a predictable number of Aeon coins in circulation. Aeon
      follows the smooth supply emission schedule of Monero with a slight delay
      being that it was launched in June whereas Monero was launched in April of
      2014. Thus it slowly approaches 18.44 million (2**64/(10**12)) coins from
      genesis block to approximately 2022. Once the block reward reaches 1.2
      coins, the reward remains fixed at that amount so that the supply grows at
      a constant rate each year. See also: Tail Emission. [1][2] </p>
    <h4> Tail Emission </h4>
    <p> Aeon relies on a constant block reward to ensure a perpetual incentive
      for miners to secure the network. This is fixed to 1.2 coins per block
      which amounts to creating about 157,680 coins each year. [1][2] </p>
    <h4> Fees and Mining Reward </h4>
    <p> With a constant block reward for miners, the security of the blockchain
      does not depend on the fees paid by its network users. Thus fees can be
      very low so long as there is no spam to the blockchain. Thus there is
      currently a fixed minimum fee set to 0.0001 coins/KB. [3] </p>
    <h4> Block Size Limit </h4>
    <p> Because the security of the network is guaranteed by the tail emission
      reward, there does not need to be any imposed artificial restrictions to
      the block size limit. Thus the block size limit can grow as necessary to
      allow for increased transaction throughput. To prevent spam there is a
      hard limit of twice the median of the size of the previous 100 blocks.[1]
      In order for a miner to raise the block size limit, they must incur a
      penalty to their block reward. penalty=base_reward * ((block size / median
      size of last 100 blocks) - 1)^2. reward=base_reward - penalty. Miners can
      avoid this fee altogether by refusing to include transactions in blocks
      that would lead to exceeding the median block size, although this is
      likely not the optimal practice as including such transactions will often
      still be profitable. Miners can create their own criteria for including
      transactions in blocks by balancing transaction fees collected against the
      quadratic miners penalty that will be applied. For example for all blocks
      exceeding the median blocksize they could enforce minimum transaction fees
      with a formula that scales fee requirements to compensate for the
      quadratic penalty.[20] </p>
    <h3> 3. Network Consensus </h3>
    <p> The Aeon network relies on the proof-of-work system innovated by the
      Bitcoin protocol. </p>
    <h4> Difficulty Adjustment </h4>
    <h5> Version 1 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. The adjustment algorithm
      examines 720 prior blocks, starting from 15 blocks ago. Of those 720
      blocks, the 60 highest and lowest block times are excluded from the
      analysis, which leaves 600 blocks. Out of those 600 blocks, the average
      block time is determined. This average is then used to adjust the
      difficulty proportionally in order to target a 120 second block time.
      Difficulty is defined as the number of hash attempts required, on average,
      to find a valid hash for the block every 120 seconds. [4][5] </p>
    <h5> Version 2 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1280000, Version 0.14.0.0 - Oct 4, 2020. The delay is dropped
      from 15 blocks to 8 blocks. The sort/cutting highest and lowest block
      times is removed, thus all 720 blocks are included in the difficulty
      calculation. [31]</p>
    <h4> Block Time Interval </h4>
    <h5> Version 1 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. Because Aeon was launched as a
      clone of Monero, it started with a one minute block time. </p>
    <h5> Version 2 </h5>
    <p> Height: 592000, Version 0.9.0.0 - Jul 21, 2015. Seeing that there were
      many empty blocks adding unwanted bloat, this was modified to a 4 minute
      block time. </p>
    <h4> Timestamp </h4>
    <p> The timestamp of an acceptable block is restricted to being no more than
      two hours of the node's local time and no less than the median of the
      previous 60 blocks. [6] </p>
    <h4> Mining Algorithms </h4>
    <h5> CryptoNight </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. The standard CryptoNote
      protocol hashing algorithm. CryptoNight is a memory-hard hash function. It 
      is designed to be inefficiently computable on GPU, FPGA and ASIC 
      architectures. The CryptoNight algorithm's first step is initializing 
      large scratchpad with pseudo-random data. The next step is numerous 
      read/write operations at pseudo-random addresses contained in the 
      scratchpad. The final step is hashing the entire scratchpad to produce 
      the resulting value. [7] </p>
    <h5> CryptoNight-Lite </h5>
    <p> Height: 592000, Version: 0.9.0.0 - Jul 21, 2015. There are two
      modifications: the scratchpad is only half the size of regular Cryptonight
      (1 MB rather than 2 MB) and the number of AES iterations is halved (half a
      million rather than a million). This makes a light hash about 4 times as
      fast as a regular one. [8] </p>
    <h5> KangarooTwelve </h5>
    <p> Height: 1146200, Version 0.13.0.0 - Sep 24, 2019. Aeon originally set
      out to be an ASIC resistant mined coin using Cryptonite and this was
      successful for many years. Eventually, ASIC miners arrived to the network
      which caused a debate on whether AEON should continue to support ASIC
      resistance or to switch to a different hash function. Through much
      deliberation, it was decided to switch to a more efficient algorithm to
      create a lower barrier of entry for miners and to make it easier to
      compute the hash. The algorithm chosen was KangarooTwelve. This algorithm
      was designed by the winners of the SHA-3 competition. [9][21][22] </p>
    <h3> 4. Transactions </h3>
    <h4> Ring signatures </h4>
    <p> Ring signature refers to the essential mechanism Aeon relies on to
      protect identifying information of network users. Transactions are signed
      using the basic Ring signature scheme used in Monero, such that each
      signer of the transaction has a plausible deniability. The ring signature
      size of Aeon is fixed to 3. This is recognized as a balanced comprise
      between maintaining privacy and keeping transactions lightweight to
      prevent large blockchain size increases. [17][18][19] </p>
    <h4> Stealth Addresses </h4>
    <p> A stealth address is a minimum piece of information compacted to a 
      single 95-character base58 string which the recipient needs to give to 
      the sender in order to receive  aeon. The information encoded in the 
      address is the network byte, public spend key, public view key and a 
      checksum. The bare minimum which the sender needs are the 2 public keys, 
      but the network byte and the checksum are added to prevent errors. Any 
      Aeon address is a stealth address. They're called stealth addresses 
      because no aeon are actually sent to the address itself, ie it never 
      appears on the blockchain. Instead, it's used by the sender to create a 
      one-time destination from which only the intended recipient can spend. 
      [10] </p>
    <h4> RingCT </h4>
    <p> The Aeon codebase currently omits the use of RingCT. There are no plans
      to add this feature as developers have opted to favor security of the
      supply over enhanced privacy protections. </p>
    <h3> 5. Wallet </h3>
    <h4> Public-key cryptography </h4>
    <p> General terms specific to public-key cryptography where a private key
      and a public key make up a keypair. A public key is derived from the
      private key. The public key is safe to share, and gives the recipient the
      ability to encrypt something or verify a signature. The private key gives
      the owner the ability to sign or decrypts something, so should be kept
      private. It's important that private keys are generated in a good way as
      they shouldn't be easy to guess. [10][24] </p>
    <h4> View Keypair </h4>
    <p> The public part of it makes up the 2nd half of aeon address, and is used
      by the sender to generate a one-time stealth address to where the funds
      are actually sent. The owner of the wallet uses the private view key to
      scan the blockchain and find the funds sent to his address. At the
      protocol level, the sender performs an encryption with the recipient's
      public view key, and the recipient attempts to decrypt all the outputs on
      the blockchain to find the one belonging to him (where decryption was
      successful). For audit purposes, it could be shared with the auditor,
      along with the signed key images to prove the balance of a wallet. Sharing
      only the view key would enable the auditor only to see received
      transactions, but he wouldn't be able to tell if any funds were spent, so
      he couldn't know the actual balance. [10][24] </p>
    <h4> Spend Keypair </h4>
    <p> The public part of it makes up the 1st half of aeon address, and is used
      to make new transactions and participate in ring signatures. The private
      spend key is used to sign a key image when the owner wants to spend funds,
      and the public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of
      the key image and accept the transaction as valid. This is what prevents
      double-spend as the network enforces the rule that a key image can be
      spent only once. I'd like to expand this a bit, but I'm a bit lacking
      here, so can't right now. [10][24] </p>
    <h4> Multisignature </h4>
    <p> Aeon supports the arbitrary M of N multi-signature wallet scheme from
      Monero.[14][23] Monero doesn't directly implement multisignatures (at 
      least not in a classical sense). Monero emulates the feature by secret 
      splitting. Transactions are still signed with a single spend key. The 
      spend key is a sum of all N private keys. The rationale for such design 
      is to decouple multisig from ring signatures. [30]</p>
    <h4> Mnemonic Seed </h4>
    <p> Minimum piece of information used to restore the cryptographic keys that
      make up the wallet. Basically, just a very very big number impossible to
      guess. I'd like to separate the mnemonic and seed terms: seed: a 256bit
      integer (usually represented as a 64 digit base16 number); mnemonic: in
      this context, a word representation of the seed, with one extra word used
      as a checksum. Both represent the same thing, but the mnemonic is a human
      readable form of it. Convention currently in use consists of encoding the
      seed using a 1626 words dictionary which results in a 24-word mnemonic. A
      CRC32 checksum is performed on them to give the 25th word which is used
      for error checking. The seed itself, if smaller than a certain number, is
      used directly as the private spend key. Otherwise a seed mod l operation
      is performed to obtain the private key from the seed, where l is a very
      big number, specific to the elliptic curve used in Aeon cryptography. The
      private view key is derived deterministically from the private spend key
      (it doesn't have to be) and that is why we call such wallets
      deterministic. [10] The aeon mnemonic word list can be found in [27].</p>
    <h4> Payment ID </h4>
    <p> A Payment ID is feature developed to make it easier for the sender to 
      prove to the recipient that he sent him the funds. Due to Aeon privacy 
      features, the recipient can't tell from where the funds came. However, if 
      there's a payment ID attached to it, it would give him a clue. Payment IDs 
      should be randomly generated for each transaction to avoid linking 
      transactions. It works like this: 1. Recipient gives the sender his 
      address and an unique payment ID 2. Sender sends the Aeon with payment ID 
      specified 3. Recipient sees an incoming transaction with the payment ID 
      specified, and he can know that it came from that specific user because 
      only that user could have known the payment ID. [10] </p>
    <h4> Addresses </h4>
    <h5> Integrated Address </h5>
    <p> Integrated addresses are an amalgamation of a standard Monero address
      and a short payment id, bundled in one single string. They are intended to
      be used when a recipient requires a payment id, and they have two main
      advantages over the historical practice of supplying a standard address
      and a payment id: (*) it is self contained, including a checksum, so it
      becomes a lot harder for the payer to forget the payment id, which is a
      common cause of trouble. (*) integrated addresses use a short payment id
      (64 bits, as opposed to the original 256 bit standalone payment ids),
      which will always be encrypted on the blockchain, increasing privacy (and
      decreasing blockchain size usage slightly). Note that it is trivial to go
      from an integrated address to the standard address plus payment id. Thus,
      an integrated address should NOT be viewed as a way to obscure one's
      address from the sender. Not many exchanges and other merchants currently
      support integrated addresses, however, but their use is encouraged for the
      above reasons. [12] </p>
    <h5> Subaddress </h5>
    <p> Aeon supports the subaddress functionality from Monero. [13] </p>
    <h5> Address Types and Prefixes </h5>
    <p> Public addresses start with "Wm". Integrated addresses use "Wz".
      Subadresses use "Xn". [11] </p>
    <h5> Base58 </h5>
    <p> Aeon has its own variant of Base58. In Aeon the Base58 encoding is 
      performed in 8-byte blocks, except the last block which is the remaining 
      (8 or less) bytes. The 8-byte block converts to 11 or less Base58 
      characters. If the block converted to less then 11 characters, the output 
      is padded with "1"s (0 in Base58). The final block is padded as well to 
      whatever would be the maximum size of this number of bytes encoded in 
      Base58. The advantage of Monero implementation is that output is of a 
      fixed size which is not the case with plain Base58. The disadvantage is 
      that default libraries won't work. The alphabet for the variant of Base58 
      is 123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz [25][26]
