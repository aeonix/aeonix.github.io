          <h3>Private</h3>
          <p>By default, AEON utilizes a cryptographic system to transfer funds without the identifying information of each user becoming visible on the blockchain.</p>

          <p>AEON uses ring signatures to make transactions untraceable, meaning it is very difficult for blockchain analysis to determine if funds have been spent.</p>

          <h2>How is AEON different from Monero?</h2>
          <p style="font-weight:600;">Compared to our CryptoNote big brother, here are AEON's main advantages:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <ul class="steps-list">
          <li>
            <span>1</span>
            <h4>Mobile-friendly</h4>
            <p>1 MB scratchpad allows AEON to run efficiently on mobile devices alongside regular laptops and desktops.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2</span>
            <h4>Different proof-of-work</h4>
            <p>AEON's lightweight PoW (CryptoNote-Lite) allows for faster verification of the blockchain.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>3</span>
            <h4>Blockchain pruning for scalability</h4>
            <p>Pruning allows the blockchain to stay small and not outgrow devices with limited storage. This feature also improves anonymity by reducing age-based attacks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>4</span>
            <h4>Fast syncing</h4>
            <p>Compared to Bitcoin variants, CryptoNote coins typically have higher verification, leading to more orphaned blocks. AEON helps this issue by using a 4-minute blocktime, reducing sync by a factor of four. Coupled with our lighter PoW, sync times on lower end devices can be improved by 10x or more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>5</span>
            <h4>Optional lightweight transfers</h4>
            <p>As a CryptoNote coin, payments are still anonymous by default. But unlike Monero, AEON also allows for <em>traceable</em> transfers. These are a faster lower-fee option for non-sensitive payments, like transferring to/from exchanges.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="difference-summary">
          Overall, AEON seeks to be a lightweight-Monero, similar to how Litecoin seeks to be a lightweight-Bitcoin. While still drawing from the technical advantages of Monero and CryptoNote, AEON has distinct development goals and an independent community that enable it to thrive as its own currency.
