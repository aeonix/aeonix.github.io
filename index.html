    <h1>AEON</h1>
    <section>
    <p> Aeon was annouced on BitcoinTalk forums, June 6, 2014, as a cryptocurrency 
      based on the CryptoNote protocol. [39] Since then, the Aeon codebase 
      has intentionally been kept close to Monero's (another CryptoNote fork) in 
      order to benefit from the higher code reliability (due to the larger resources 
      of peer reviewing available to Monero). Over time, Aeon has evolved a few 
      unique differences such as size 3 ring signatures, asic-friendly mining, 
      and omitting ring-ct proofs. As a direct result of this, Aeon serves as a 
      lighter, stabler alternative to Monero. All coins have been 100% proof-of-work 
      mined with no coin sale, no ICO, no pre-mine, no tax etc. </p>

    <h3> I. Mission </h3>
    <p> Being a fork of Monero, Aeon shares most of its codebase with Monero
      while making a few critical modifications such that it can offer a unique
      alternative. The codebase is intentionally kept close to Monero's in order
      to benefit from the higher code reliability (due to the larger source of
      peer reviewing available in Monero). By maintaining a stable codebase,
      Aeon can ensure security and fairness for all network participants. [15]
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h3> II. Economics </h3>
    <h4> 1. Total Supply </h4>
    <p> There is always a predictable number of Aeon coins in circulation. Aeon
      follows the smooth supply emission schedule of Monero with a slight delay
      being that it was launched in June whereas Monero was launched in April of
      2014. Thus it slowly approaches 18.44 million coins from genesis block to 
      approximately 2022. Once the block reward reaches 1.2 coins, the reward 
      remains fixed at that amount so that the supply grows at a constant rate 
      each year. [1,2,39] </p>
    <h4> 2. Tail Emission </h4>
    <p> Aeon relies on a constant block reward to ensure a perpetual incentive
      for miners to secure the network. This is fixed to 1.2 coins per block
      which amounts to creating about 157,680 coins each year. [1,2] </p>
    <h4> 3. Fees and Mining Reward </h4>
    <p> With a constant block reward for miners, the security of the blockchain
      does not depend on the fees paid by its network users. Thus fees can be
      very low so long as there is no spam to the blockchain. Thus there is
      currently a fixed minimum fee set to 0.001 coins/KB. [3] </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h3> III. Network Consensus </h3>
    <p> The Aeon network derives its security from the proof-of-work system 
      innovated by the Bitcoin protocol. </p>
    <h4> 1. Mining Algorithms </h4>
    <h5> CryptoNight </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. The standard CryptoNote
      protocol hashing algorithm. CryptoNight is a memory-hard hash function. It 
      is designed to be inefficiently computable on GPU, FPGA and ASIC 
      architectures. [7,39] </p>
    <h5> CryptoNight-Lite </h5>
    <p> Height: 592000, Version: 0.9.0.0 - Jul 21, 2015. There are two
      modifications: the scratchpad is only half the size of regular Cryptonight
      (1 MB rather than 2 MB) and the number of AES iterations is halved (half a
      million rather than a million). This makes a light hash about 4 times as
      fast as a regular one. [8] </p>
    <h5> KangarooTwelve </h5>
    <p> Height: 1146200, Version 0.13.0.0 - Sep 24, 2019. KangarooTwelve is a 
      higher-performance reduced-round (from 24 to 12 rounds) version of Keccak 
      which claims to have 128 bits of security while having performance as high
       as 0.55 cycles per byte on a Skylake CPU. [9,21,22,34,35] </p>
    <h4> 2. Difficulty Adjustment </h4>
    <h5> Version 1 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. The adjustment algorithm
      examines 720 prior blocks, starting from 15 blocks ago. Of those 720
      blocks, the 60 highest and lowest block times are excluded from the
      analysis, which leaves 600 blocks. Out of those 600 blocks, the average
      block time is determined. This average is then used to adjust the
      difficulty proportionally in order to target a 120 second block time.
      Difficulty is defined as the number of hash attempts required, on average,
      to find a valid hash for the block every 120 seconds. [4,5,39] </p>
    <h5> Version 2 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1280000, Version 0.14.0.0 - Oct 4, 2020. The delay is dropped
      from 15 blocks to 8 blocks. The sort/cutting highest and lowest block
      times is removed, thus all 720 blocks are included in the difficulty
      calculation. [31]</p>
    <h4> 3. Block Size Limit </h4>
    <p> Because the security of the network is guaranteed by the tail emission
      reward, there does not need to be any imposed artificial restrictions to
      the block size limit. Thus the block size limit can grow as necessary to
      allow for increased transaction throughput. To prevent spam there is a
      hard limit of twice the median of the size of the previous 100 blocks. [1]
      In order for a miner to raise the block size limit, they must incur a
      penalty to their block reward. [20] This penalty limit begins from max( 
      20,000 bytes, median of previous 100 blocks ). [1,36,39]</p>
    <h4> 4. Transaction Size Limit </h4>
    <p> The Aeon transaction size limit is 25,000 bytes. [37]</p>
    <h4> 5. Block Time Interval </h4>
    <h5> Version 1 </h5>
    <p> Height: 1, Version 0.8.9.1 - Jun 6, 2014. Because Aeon was launched as a
      clone of Monero, it started with a one minute block time. </p>
    <h5> Version 2 </h5>
    <p> Height: 592000, Version 0.9.0.0 - Jul 21, 2015. Seeing that there were
      many empty blocks adding unwanted bloat, this was modified to a 4 minute
      block time. </p>
    <h4> 6. Timestamp </h4>
    <p> The timestamp of an acceptable block is restricted to being no more than
      two hours of the node's local time and no less than the median of the
      previous 60 blocks. [6] </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h3> IV. Private Transactions </h3>
    <h4> 1. Group signature </h4>
    <p> Group signature refers to the essential mechanism Aeon relies on to
      protect identifying information of network users. Transactions are signed
      using the basic Group signature scheme used in Monero, such that each
      signer of the transaction has a plausible deniability. The group signature
      size of Aeon is fixed to 3. This is recognized as a balanced comprise
      between maintaining privacy and keeping transactions lightweight to
      prevent large blockchain size increases. [17,18,19] </p>
    <h4> 2. Dual-keypair Address </h4>
    <p> An Aeon address is a 95-character base58 string which the recipient 
      gives to the sender in order to receive aeon. The information encoded in the 
      address is the network byte, public spend key, public view key and a 
      checksum. The bare minimum which the sender needs are the 2 public keys, 
      but the network byte and the checksum are added to prevent errors. Every 
      Aeon address is a dual-keypair address. The sender uses these keys to create 
      an encrypted output id from which only the intended recipient can view 
      the ownership (view key) and create a spend (spend key). 
      [10,39] </p>
    <h4> 3. RingCT </h4>
    <p> The Aeon codebase currently omits the use of RingCT which is used in 
      the Monero protocol to encrypt transaction amounts. There are no plans to 
      add this feature as developers have opted to favor security of the supply 
      over enhanced privacy protections. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h3> V. Wallet </h3>
    <h4> 1. Public-key cryptography </h4>
    <p> Public-key cryptography is where a private key and a public key make up 
      a keypair. A public key is derived from the private key. The public key is 
      safe to share, and gives the recipient the ability to encrypt something or 
      verify a signature. The private key gives the owner the ability to sign or 
      decrypts something, so should be kept private. It's important that private 
      keys are generated in a good way as they shouldn't be easy to guess. 
      [10,24] </p>
    <h4> 2. Dual-keypair Wallets</h4>
    <p> The CryptoNote protocol introduced the notion of the dual-keypair wallet 
      system whereby transactions are encrypted through the spend and view 
      keypairs. [39] </p>
    <h5> Spend Keypair </h5>
    <p> The public spend key forms half of an aeon address, and is used
      to make new transactions and participate in ring signatures. The private
      spend key is used to form an input when the owner wants to spend funds.
      The public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of
      the input and accept the transaction as valid. [10,24,39] </p>
    <h5> View Keypair </h5>
    <p> The public view key makes up the 2nd half of an aeon address. Someone who 
      wants to receive aeon gives the sender their address to generate a 256-bit 
      encrypted output id for each output sent. The receiver can use their private 
      view key to decrypt the output ids and find which belong to their address. 
      [10,24,38,39] </p>
    <h4> 3. Multisignature </h4>
    <p> Aeon supports the arbitrary M of N multi-signature wallet scheme from
      Monero. [14,23] Monero doesn't directly implement multisignatures (at 
      least not in a classical sense). Monero emulates the feature by secret 
      splitting. Transactions are still signed with a single spend key. The 
      spend key is a sum of all N private keys. The rationale for such design 
      is to decouple multisig from ring signatures. [30]</p>
    <h4> 4. Mnemonic Seed </h4>
    <p> Minimum piece of information used to restore the cryptographic keys that
      make up the wallet. To separate the mnemonic and seed terms: seed: a 256bit
      integer (usually represented as a 64 digit base16 number); mnemonic: in
      this context, a word representation of the seed, with one extra word used
      as a checksum. Both represent the same thing, but the mnemonic is a human
      readable form of it. [10] The aeon mnemonic word list can be found in 
      english.h. [27] </p>
    <h4> 5. Payment ID </h4>
    <p> A Payment ID is a feature developed to make it easier for the sender to 
      prove to the recipient that he sent him the funds. Due to Aeon privacy 
      features, the recipient can't tell from where the funds came. However, if 
      there's a payment ID attached to it, it would give him a clue. [10] </p>
    <h4> 6. Addresses Types </h4>
    <h5> Integrated Address </h5>
    <p> Integrated addresses are an amalgamation of a standard Aeon address
      and a short payment id, bundled in one single string. They are intended to
      be used when a recipient requires a payment id, and they have some 
      advantages over the practice of supplying a standard address and a 
      payment id: * it is self contained, including a checksum. * integrated 
      addresses use a 64 bit payment id (as opposed to the standalone 256 bit 
      payment ids) which are always encrypted on the blockchain, increasing 
      privacy (and decreasing blockchain size usage slightly). [12] </p>
    <h5> Subaddress </h5>
    <p> Aeon supports the subaddress functionality from Monero. [13] </p>
    <h5> Address Types and Prefixes </h5>
    <p> Public addresses start with "Wm". Integrated addresses use "Wz".
      Subadresses use "Xn". [11] </p>
    <h5> Base58 </h5>
    <p> Aeon has CryptoNote Base58 encoding scheme. The alphabet for the variant 
      of Base58 is 123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz. 
      [24,25,26]
